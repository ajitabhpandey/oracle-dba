My collection of Oracle DBA scripts

This repository is a collection of some shell scripts which I wrote over a period of time to help me administer Oracle database servers.

The name of the script files are self-explanatory, so am not spending time in writing detailed description of what these script do. Maybe at a later point in time when I add new scripts which may need explanation, I will add more details here.
